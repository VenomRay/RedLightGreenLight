# Red Light, Green Light Camera Game

## Description
This Python tool allows you to play the popular game "Red Light, Green Light" using your computer's camera. The game simulates the classic children's game where players must move forward when the light is green and freeze when the light turns red.

## Features
- Utilizes OpenCV library for camera input
- Detects player movement and responds accordingly
- Generates red and green lights for gameplay

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- OpenCV library (install with `pip install opencv-python`)
- Webcam or camera connected to your computer

## Usage
1. Clone or download this repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Run the file using Python: `python main.py`.
4. Follow the on-screen instructions to play the game.
5. Move forward when the light is green and freeze when the light is red.
6. Enjoy playing!
7. click 

## How It Works
The program uses the computer's camera to capture video frames. It analyzes each frame to determine if the dominant color is green (for "go") or red (for "stop"). Based on the color detection, it prompts the player to move forward or freeze. The game continues until the player decides to quit.

## Known Issues
- Lighting conditions and camera quality may affect color detection accuracy.
- Movement detection may not be perfect and could result in false positives or negatives.

## Future Improvements
- Implement better color detection algorithms for improved accuracy.
- Add options for adjusting game difficulty.
- Incorporate sound effects or additional visual cues for a more immersive experience.
- Provide multiplayer support for playing with friends remotely.
